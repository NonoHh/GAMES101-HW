<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Repo.

This repository was built to record the process of learning the GAMES 101 course, primarily the programming assignments in the course. 

If any other students studying this course find the repository, I hope you that **don't copy the code**, my code may give you some insight, after that you can work independently.

I'm also an introductory learner of Computer Graphics, so if there are any mistakes in the code, please issue it, it's much appreciated.


### Built With

* GAMES101 teaching team
* NonoHh



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Assignments

This repository stores assignments that broadcasted live on Huya in the spring of 2020.

The requirements and basic code framework for the assignment can be downloaded from the [summary post](http://games-cn.org/forums/topic/allhw/) in the BBS.
